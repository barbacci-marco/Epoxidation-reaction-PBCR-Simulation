# Epoxidation-reaction-PBCR-Simulation

This project focuses on designing an optimized reactor system for the industrial production of ethylene oxide (EO), an essential chemical used in manufacturing polyester fibers, surfactants, and pharmaceuticals. The reactor design is based on a multi-tubular fixed-bed configuration, which uses catalytic oxidation of ethylene with oxygen to produce EO at a target rate of 100 tonnes per day. The project aims to balance high conversion rates with economic efficiency through the implementation of interstage cooling and the use of advanced modeling techniques.

Using MATLAB, the team developed a comprehensive simulation that solves the complex ordinary differential equations governing reaction kinetics, mass, and energy balances. These equations model the reaction system, accounting for key factors such as temperature control, pressure drops, and optimal catalyst utilization. Economic analysis guided decisions on the number of reactors, interstage coolers, and operational conditions to achieve a conversion rate of 85% while minimizing costs.

The final design includes a series of 16 reactors with 406 tubes each and 15 interstage coolers, maintaining the reactor temperature within safe operational limits. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the impact of parameters such as feed temperature, catalyst weight, and bed voidage, leading to insights on how to further improve production efficiency. This design provides a scalable and cost-effective solution to ethylene oxide production, offering insights that can be applied to other large-scale chemical processes.
